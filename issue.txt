The dash state is able to interrupt attacks, so if you attack and then mid attack you push away from the attack direction and dash, the player will dash backwards without flipping the sprite.When dashing after the attack finishes and the direction has changes means the dash is normal. Is this expected or just unaccounted for? Or did I miss something in the dash tutorial that prevents dash from interrupting the attack mid swing or corrects facing direction when interrupting a combo attack?Say in an example that we are attacking to the right and then we dash to the left mid attack, interrupting the attack mid swing. Checking debug for player in the inspector IÂ can see the issue, isFacingRight is still true and facingDirection is 1.So we have an issue where interrupting combo attack to dash in the opposite direction does not properly set the facing direction and boolean properly because the xVelocity doesn't change when changing the direction mid attack. So we need some kind of check for when dash interrupts the attack in the opposite direction.
